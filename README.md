# Meteor Now [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/meteor-now.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/meteor-now)

`meteor-now` is a tool to let you instantly deploy your Meteor apps with [now](http://zeit.co/now) with one command.

Just do `meteor-now -e ROOT_URL=... -e MONGO_URL=...` and instantly deploy your meteor app like you could back in the good 'ol days of `meteor deploy`.

## Demo

# Usage
## Install
Install the `now` and `meteor-now` packages:
```
$ npm install -g now meteor-now
```

## Configure `now` account

# Additional Info
## Using METEOR_SETTINGS
Currently there are two ways you can set the METEOR_SETTINGS environment variable in your deployments

- Using `now secrets`
```
$ now secrets add meteor-settings '{ "public": { "foo": "bar" }}'
$ meteor-now -e METEOR_SETTINGS=@meteor-settings -e ROOT_URL=... -e MONGO_URL=...
```

- Using `development.settings.json` and `production.settings.json`
Following the convention of the `NODE_ENV` environment varaibe, `meteor-now` uses `NODE_ENV` to determine which file to look for.
It will either look for `development.settings.json` or `production.settings.json` in your root Meteor directory.

Note that `meteor-now` will look for `development.settings.json` by default unless `NODE_ENV` is set to production or METEOR_SETTINGS was passed in as a result of the first option above.
